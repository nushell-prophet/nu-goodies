# The Song of the *Falcon* (excerpt)

"High up in the mountains, a Snake crawled and lay in a damp gorge, coiled into a knot, staring out at the sea.

"The sun was shining high in the *sky*, and the mountains were exhaling heat into the *sky*, and the waves were crashing below against the rocks...

"Through the gorge, amidst darkness and splashes, a stream rushed towards the sea, thundering with stones...

"Covered in white foam, gray and strong, it cut through the mountain and fell into the sea, howling angrily.

"Suddenly, into that gorge where the Snake was coiled, a *Falcon* fell from the *sky* with a shattered chest, bloodied feathers...

"With a short cry, it fell to the ground and beat its chest in powerless rage against the hard rock...

"The Snake was frightened, slithered away swiftly, but soon understood that the bird had only two or three minutes of life left...

"It crawled closer to the shattered bird and hissed directly into its eyes:

"'So, you're dying?'

"'Yes, I'm dying!' the *Falcon* answered, sighing deeply. 'I've lived a glorious life! I know happiness! I've fought bravely! I've seen the *sky*... You'll never see it that close! Ah, you poor thing!

"'So what, the *sky*? An empty place... How could I crawl there? I'm perfectly fine here... warm and damp!'

"That's how the Snake responded to the free bird and smiled inwardly at it for these delusions.

"It thought: 'Fly or crawl, the end is known: everyone will lie in the earth, everyone will turn to dust...'

"But the brave *Falcon* suddenly stirred, rose slightly, and looked around the gorge...

"Water was seeping through the gray stone; it was stuffy in the dark gorge and smelled of decay.

"And the *Falcon* cried out with sorrow and pain, gathering all its strength:

"'Oh, if only I could rise to the *sky* just once more! I would press my enemy... to the wounds on my chest and... he would choke on my blood! Oh, the joy of battle!'

"And the Snake thought: 'It must indeed be pleasant to live in the *sky* if he moans like that!'

"And it suggested to the free bird: 'Why don't you move to the edge of the gorge and throw yourself down.

"Maybe your wings will lift you, and you'll live a little longer in your element.'

"The *Falcon* trembled, and, crying out proudly, went to the cliff, sliding its claws over the slimy rock.

"It approached, spread its wings, took a deep breath, sparkled with its eyes, and—rolled down.

"And like a stone, sliding down the rocks, it quickly fell, breaking its wings, losing its feathers...

"The wave of the stream caught it, washed away its blood, dressed it in foam, and carried it into the sea.

"And the waves of the sea crashed against the rock with a mournful roar... And the bird's body was nowhere to be seen in the vast sea..."

"Lying in a ravine, the Snake pondered long about the death of a bird, about the passion for the *sky*.

"Then he looked into that distance, which forever caresses the eyes with dreams of happiness.

"'What did the deceased *Falcon* see in this bottomless, edgeless desert? Why do those like him who have died disturb the soul with their love for soaring in the *sky*? What clarity do they find there? I could have known all this if I had flown into the *sky*, even if just briefly.'

"He spoke and acted. Coiling into a ring, he leapt into the air and flashed a narrow ribbon at the sun.

"'Born to crawl—cannot fly!' Forgetting this, he fell onto the rocks but did not die; he laughed...

"'So this is the charm of flights into the *sky*! It is in the fall! Silly birds! Not knowing the earth, yearning for it, they strive high into the *sky* and seek life in the scorching desert. It's empty there. There's a lot of light, but no food and no support for a living body. Why the pride then? Why the reproaches? To cover up the madness of their desires and to hide behind them their unworthiness for the affairs of life? Silly birds! But they will no longer deceive me with their talks! I know everything myself! I have seen the *sky*... I soared into it, measured it, knew the fall, but did not break, only now I believe in myself more strongly. Let those who cannot love the earth live by deception. I know the truth. And I will not believe their calls. Earth's creation—I live by the earth.'

"And he curled into a ball on a rock, proud of himself.

"The sea shone, all in bright light, and the waves fiercely hit the shore.

"In their lion-like roar, a song about the proud bird thundered; the rocks trembled from their blows, the *sky* trembled from the fearsome song:

"'We sing the glory to the madness of the brave!

"The madness of the brave is the wisdom of life! Oh, brave *Falcon*! You bled in battle with enemies... But there will be a time—drops of your hot blood, like sparks, will flare up in the darkness of life and will ignite many brave hearts with a mad thirst for freedom, for light!

"Let you have died! But in the song of the brave and the strong in spirit, you will always be a living example, a proud call to freedom, to light!

"We sing a song to the madness of the brave!'"
